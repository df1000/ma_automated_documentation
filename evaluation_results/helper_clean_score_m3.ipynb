      "The goal of the project is to train a small language model called MiniMind from scratch, using only 3 dollars in cost and 2 hours of time. The project aims to provide a tutorial for beginners to learn about large language models (LLMs) by training a small model themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "### q2: Why is the project useful?\n",
      "\n",
      "The project is useful because it lowers the barrier to entry for learning about LLMs. By providing a step-by-step guide and the necessary resources, users can learn how to train a language model from scratch, even with limited resources. This can help demystify the process and make it more accessible to a wider audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### q3: How can users get started with the project?\n",
      "\n",
      "Users can get started with the project by following the instructions provided in the README. This includes cloning the repository, setting up the environment, downloading the necessary data, and running the training scripts. The README provides detailed instructions and code examples to help users get started.\n",
      "\n",
      "### q4: Where can users get help with your project?\n",
      "\n",
      "Users can get help with the project by reaching out to the maintainers and contributors listed in the README. They can also refer to the issues section of the repository for discussions and solutions to common problems. Additionally, the README provides links to external resources and documentation that can be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "### q5: Who maintains and contributes to the project?\n",
