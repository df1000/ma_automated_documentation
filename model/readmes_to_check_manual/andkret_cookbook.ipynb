      "\n",
      "## Description\n",
      "The Cookbook repository is a software project that aims to create a system for text summarization and information retrieval using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and Elasticsearch. The system is designed to process text data, generate embeddings, and store them in an Elasticsearch vector store.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installation\n",
      "To install the Cookbook repository, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/andkret/Cookbook.git`\n",
      "2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
      "3. Set up an Elasticsearch instance and configure the connection settings in the `.env` file\n",
      "4. Run the `extract_text_from_pdf` function to extract text from PDF files\n",
      "5. Use the `OllamaEmbedding` class to generate embeddings for the preprocessed text\n",
      "6. Use the `IngestionPipeline` class to process the text data, split it into chunks, and store the embeddings in the Elasticsearch vector store\n",
      "\n",
      "## Usage\n",
      "To use the Cookbook repository, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Preprocess the text data using the `extract_text_from_pdf` function\n",
      "2. Generate embeddings for the preprocessed text using the `OllamaEmbedding` class\n",
      "3. Use the `IngestionPipeline` class to process the text data and store the embeddings in the Elasticsearch vector store\n",
      "4. Use a query engine to execute user queries against the vector store and retrieve relevant results\n",
      "\n",
      "## Contributing\n",
      "Contributions to the Cookbook repository are welcome! To contribute, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
