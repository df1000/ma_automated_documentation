      "\n",
      "## Description\n",
      "The OpenStack Git Submodule Manager is a Python script designed to manage Git submodules for OpenStack projects. It fetches a list of integrated gate repositories, generates a `.gitmodules` file, and configures the Git submodules accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installation\n",
      "To install the OpenStack Git Submodule Manager, you will need to have Python and Git installed on your system. You will also need to install the `requests` and `yaml` libraries using pip:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install requests yaml\n",
      "```\n",
      "## Usage\n",
      "To use the script, simply run it from the command line:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "python openstack_git_submodule_manager.py\n",
      "```\n",
      "This will fetch the list of integrated gate repositories, generate the `.gitmodules` file, and configure the Git submodules.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Contributing\n",
      "Contributions to the OpenStack Git Submodule Manager are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the standard OpenStack contribution guidelines.\n",
