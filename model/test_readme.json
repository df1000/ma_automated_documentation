    "summary": " This repository is a Python script that fetches and generates a list of most popular repositories on GitHub based on the given programming language. The script uses the GitHub API to retrieve the required information and stores the access token in a local file named \"token.json\". The script supports multiple programming languages and can fetch up to 10 pages of results per language.\n\nThe script defines a class `RepositoryInformationProvider` that initializes a `requests.Session` object with retries and rate limit handling. It also defines methods to get the next page of results for a given language and to get the last commit date for a given repository.\n\nThe `generate_readme` function generates a markdown file with a table of most popular repositories for a given language. It fetches the data using the `RepositoryInformationProvider` and formats the data into a markdown table.\n\nThe script uses several constants and variables to store the API URLs, headers, and other configuration options. It also defines some helper functions for formatting and humanizing dates.\n\nThe script uses the `argparse` module to parse command-line arguments and supports specifying multiple languages using a comma-separated list.\n\nThe main components of the script are:\n\n* `RepositoryInformationProvider` class for fetching and handling GitHub API responses\n* `generate_readme` function for generating the markdown file\n* Use of `requests` library for making HTTP requests\n* Use of `argparse` module for parsing command-line arguments\n* Use of `json`, `time`, `humanize`, `datetime`, and `argparse` modules for various utility functions\n\nThe dependencies of the script are:\n\n* `requests` library for making HTTP requests\n* `argparse` module for parsing command-line arguments\n* `json` module for parsing JSON responses\n* `time` module for handling time-related functionality\n* `humanize` module for formatting dates\n* `datetime` module for parsing and manipulating dates\n\nThe overall architecture of the script is simple and modular, with clear separation of concerns between fetching data from the API and generating the markdown file. The script is well-documented with clear variable and function names, making it easy to understand and maintain.",
    "readme": " ## Popular GitHub Repositories by Programming Language\n\nThis repository is a Python script that fetches and generates a list of most popular repositories on GitHub based on the given programming language. It uses the GitHub API to retrieve the required information and stores the access token in a local file named \"token.json\". The script supports multiple programming languages and can fetch up to 10 pages of results per language.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests argparse json humanize\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo run the script, save the provided code in a file named `github_popular_repos.py` and execute it using the following command:\n\n```bash\npython github_popular_repos.py [--language LANG1, LANG2, ...]\n```\n\nReplace `LANG1, LANG2, ...` with the desired programming languages, separated by commas. If no languages are specified, the script will fetch the popular repositories for all supported languages.\n\nThe script generates a markdown file named `repos.md` in the same directory with the most popular repositories for the given languages.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n[MIT License](LICENSE)\n\n## Development\n\nTo run the script in development mode, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\npython -m unittest tests.test_github_popular_repos.py\n```\n\nThis will run the unit tests for the script. The tests cover the main functionality of the script and ensure that the expected results are generated.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe script depends on the following Python libraries:\n\n- `requests`: for making HTTP requests\n- `argparse`: for parsing command-line arguments\n- `json`: for parsing JSON responses\n- `time`: for handling time-related functionality\n- `humanize`: for formatting dates\n- `datetime`: for parsing and manipulating dates\n\nYou can install these dependencies using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests argparse json humanize\n```"
