    ## dl-docker\n\n### Repository Summary\n\nThe `dl-docker` repository is a Dockerized environment for deep learning with TensorFlow. The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a pre-configured Docker container for running Jupyter Notebooks with TensorFlow, allowing users to easily set up and use a deep learning environment without the need for manual installation and configuration.\n\n### Installation\n\nTo get started with `dl-docker`, follow these steps:\n\n1. Install Docker on your machine if you haven't already.\n2. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/floydhub/dl-docker.git`.\n3. Navigate to the repository directory and run `docker build -t dl-docker .` to build the Docker image.\n4. Run `docker run -p 8888:8888 dl-docker` to start the Docker container.\n5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8888` to access the Jupyter Notebook server.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use the `dl-docker` environment, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new Jupyter Notebook by clicking on the \"New\" button in the top right corner of the Jupyter Notebook server.\n2. Select the Python 2 kernel from the dropdown menu.\n3. Install any additional dependencies required for your project using `!pip install <package_name>`.\n4. Use the TensorFlow library to perform deep learning tasks within your notebooks.\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions to the `dl-docker` repository are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. Make sure to follow the standard guidelines for contributing to open-source projects.\n\n### License\n\nThis project is licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe `dl-docker` repository relies on the following dependencies:\n\n* Docker\n* Jupyter Notebook\n* TensorFlow\n* IPython\n\n### Overall Architecture\n\nThe repository uses a simple and straightforward architecture, with the Dockerfile defining the environment and dependencies, and the Jupyter Notebook server running within the container. The password protection mechanism is implemented using environment variables, ensuring secure access to the Jupyter Notebook server. The multi-kernel support is achieved through the use of the `c.MultiKernelManager` class.
