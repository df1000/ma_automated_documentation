Those infrastructure\\nresources can then be accessed by end users through programmable APIs.\\n\\nThis repository just represents OpenStack as a collection of git submodules.\\nYou can find the repositories for individual components at:\\nhttps://opendev.org/openstack\\n\\nYou can learn more about the various components in OpenStack at:\\nhttps://openstack.org/software\\n\\nTo learn more about how to contribute to OpenStack, please head to our\\nContributor portal: https://www.openstack.org/community/\\n\\nTo learn more about how OpenStack is governed, you can visit:\\nhttps://governance.openstack.org/\\n\\n\\nWhy this repository ?\\n---------------------\\n\\nOur continuous integration system, Zuul, gates all of the contained projects\\nin an effective single timeline. This means that OpenStack, across all of the\\nprojects, does already have a sequence of combinations that have been\\nexplicitly tested, but it's non-trivial to go from a single commit of a\\nparticular project to the commits that were tested with it.\\n\\nGerrit's submodule tracking feature will update a super project every\\ntime a subproject is updated, so the specific sequence created by zuul\\nwill be captured by the super project commits.\\n\\nThis repo is intended to be used in a read-only manner. Any commit in this\\nrepo will get a collection of commits in the other repos that have\\nexplicitly been tested with each other, if that sort of thing is important\\nto you.\\n\""
