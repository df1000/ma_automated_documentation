User:
You are acting like GitHub documentation expert for a project called {project_name}. Your task is to create an output in JSON format which should have the following structure:

{
    'project_name': '',
    'file_name': '',
    'tags': [],
    'sum': '',
    'code': []
} 

You have to create the values for each key. Search for suitable tags (maximum of 3) for {input_file}. The value for 'sum' should contain concise summary. Don't use detailed sentences. If {input_file} contains code elements, include the most ciritcal parts (maximum of 3), focus on functionality and leaving out excessive details in the list for the key 'code', otherwise leave the value empty. It is not allowed to copy the entire code into the list, focus on the most significant parts that describe the purpose of the file. Remove '/n' and do not escape any characters.

Write your output in JSON format and keep it clean and structured. Use the given parameters and do not include any sensitive data like names or emails.

project_name = 'ollama-deep-researcher'
input_file_name = 'prompts.py'
input_file = '
query_writer_instructions="""Your goal is to generate a targeted web search query.
The query will gather information related to a specific topic.

<TOPIC>
{research_topic}
</TOPIC>

<FORMAT>
Format your response as a JSON object with ALL three of these exact keys:
   - "query": The actual search query string
   - "aspect": The specific aspect of the topic being researched
   - "rationale": Brief explanation of why this query is relevant
</FORMAT>

<EXAMPLE>
Example output:

summarizer_instructions="""
<GOAL>
Generate a high-quality summary of the web search results and keep it concise / related to the user topic.
</GOAL>

<REQUIREMENTS>
When creating a NEW summary:
1. Highlight the most relevant information related to the user topic from the search results
2. Ensure a coherent flow of information

When EXTENDING an existing summary:                                                                                                                 
1. Read the existing summary and new search results carefully.                                                    
2. Compare the new information with the existing summary.                                                         
3. For each piece of new information:                                                                             
    a. If it's related to existing points, integrate it into the relevant paragraph.                               
    b. If it's entirely new but relevant, add a new paragraph with a smooth transition.                            
    c. If it's not relevant to the user topic, skip it.                                                            
4. Ensure all additions are relevant to the user's topic.                                                         
5. Verify that your final output differs from the input summary.
