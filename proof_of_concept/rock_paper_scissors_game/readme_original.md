## ü§ñ Code Overview
Here's a brief overview of the main components of the code:

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import PhotoImage
import random

# Function to determine the computer's choice
def get_computer_choice():
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

# Function to determine the winner
def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

# Main function to handle button clicks
def on_button_click(user_choice):
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    result_label.config(text=f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n{result}")
```
